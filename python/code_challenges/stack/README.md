# Stacks
a stack is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one start of the sequence and the removal of entities from the same start of the sequence.

## Challenge
Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the sack is created.
The class should contain the following methods:
push
Arguments: value
adds a new node with that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
pop
Arguments: none
Returns: the value from node from the top of the stack
Removes the node from the top of the stack
Should raise exception when called on empty queue
peek
Arguments: none
Returns: Value of the node located at the top of the sttack
Should raise exception when called on empty stack
is empty
Arguments: none
Returns: Boolean indicating whether or not the stack is empty
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.

## Approach & Efficiency
**BigO:**
O(1) Time
O(1) sPACE
