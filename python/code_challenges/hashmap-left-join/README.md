# Hashmap Left Join
Left join means to have all the elements of the first data structure and add to them the values of matched keys in the second data structure

## Challenge
Use left join methodology to join two hashmaps and return the result

## Approach & Efficiency
Time: O(n) fully traversing the first hashmap
Space: O(n + h) where n is the length of first hashmap
